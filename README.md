# Module 1 Project - Twitter Clone

## How your website accomplished each item in the criteria.

### Applications of Concepts Taught
- We have used HTML for structuring the content of web pages.
- We have used CSS for styling the layout, color, fonts, and overall visual presentation, and also for animations and transitions to create appealing animations.
- Used Javascript for adding interactivity, form validation, and animations, providing more dynamic and interactive experiences. We have used this to make requests to fetch data from a server.
- Created responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.


### Functionality
- The functionality involves replicating various functionalities from the original platform. Users should be able to register or log in, should be able to post tweets, follow/unfollow users, have a timeline where users can see tweets from users they follow, like or unlike tweets, have a profile page where their tweets are displayed, and log from their account.

### Design and Content

- The design resembles Twitter’s familiar interface with navigation, timeline, tweet composer, and user profile.
- We have used a clean and minimal design focusing on gradients. We have selected fonts that are easy to read and convey a modern, professional look. We have also ensured that the design is responsive, so it adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices. 
- Showcased user-generated content and encouraged interaction through likes, follows/unfollows.

### Code Quality

- Implement error handling to handle unexpected situations and provide meaningful error messages to users.
- Used multiple pages for HTML, CSS, and Javascript files.
- Use meaningful variable names, function names, and comments to enhance readability and make it easier for the team to understand the code.

### Creativity 

- Implemented the light/dark mode theme for them to have customized looks based on where they are at ease.
- Aligned the theme to the name “Vespera” which evokes twilight or dusk

### Deployment

- Set up the repository in GitHub 
- Set up Netlify for deployment and placed environment variables

## Where could the concepts discussed in class be seen in your website?

- The concepts that were discussed during class were present in various parts of the website. It may be at the loading/login page, home page, and profile page since we were able to create and design the website with the usage of HTML codes, different kinds of CSS designs, animations, transitions and media queries. Lastly, the usage of JavaScript and API also helped us in enabling the website’s functionality.

## What was your inspiration for the design of the website?

- The name “Vespera”, derived from ‘vesper’ meaning ‘evening star’, sets the tone for the website’s design. Just as the evening sky transitions from vibrant hues to deep, serene colors as the sun sets, the gradient colors used in the design evoke a similar sense of transition and beauty. 

## What was your approach in creating the content of the website?

- Since the project is about cloning twitter, we first checked the features and design of twitter and got insights on what could be potentially useful for our site.  We then proceed to search more on the web about “aesthetic” designs and colors that tend to be more appealing and popular for younger generations which would later become the theme for our web. Furthermore, we looked for youtube videos in terms of web creating and designing as guides in building its coding foundation. To add, everything was agreed upon by each member and made sure that everyone is on the same page. Lastly, we also created some assets like the logo and user icon for the website.

## How is your website creative?

- Our website demonstrates creativity through its thematic elements inspired by the evening sky and the concept of the evening star, "vesper," while also showcasing innovative user experience design featuring interactive elements, intuitive navigation, and engaging content presentation.
- The use of gradient represents a moment in time, capturing the essence of dusk and the beginning of a new phase. Just as the evening star heralds the onset of a new night, Vespera symbolizes a fresh beginning and the promise of renewal. 

## What did you use to deploy your website?

- We have utilized Netlify for deploying our website, allowing for easy integration and fast access to the website. It became a crucial tool for us to simplify the deployment process and enable us to focus on delivering high-quality content for our website.

## How you worked as a team to accomplish the project

- The group first created their own MS team’s group for their group meetings where they would later discuss the project’s progress, tasks and accomplishments. 
- Secondly, the initial design of the website was first made by using Figma for prototyping and visualizing how the website would look and function, which at the same time also allows for easy adjustments on the design.
- Task division was the next step, where the team separated the parts of the website and assigned individual tasks to each member where some handled the log-in screen, the profile, the followers and the like.
- After dividing each task, the team proceeded in coding the website using JavaScript, CSS and HTML on Visual Studio Code to implement the design and functions made in Figma. Node.js was also used for the development of the site’s API. Lastly, the usage of Netlify to publish the site.


## How did you divide the tasks between the team, and what is the responsibility of each one?

- The group took a collaborative approach, ensuring tasks were divided fairly among its members. The group wanted to divide the tasks regarding the needs of the project. Noela Andosay led the charge on page layout, creating the main feed layout and overall coordination of the components. Michaella Villamante took charge of user registration and login, seamlessly weaving transitions between the two. Wilbert Laiño took charge of the profile page, lending a hand with API integration when needed. Homer Infante was assigned to make the timeline and following features, also taking the lead in main API integration. Arvin Antonio tackled responsiveness, breakpoints, and CSS media queries. Throughout the project, we maintained a sense of support and collaborativeness, lending a hand whenever possible and sharing ideas freely. This approach ensured everyone gained a well-rounded experience across tasks and enjoyed the whole project.

## How did you prevent your changes in code from conflicting with each other?

- The codes were all separated in their own function especially for displaying for home and profile pages so as to not have conflicts. It was set up like that so that it would have its own independent function instead of mixing both in one for simplicity and to be less confusing.  Moreover, we would notify each other on who would publish first and who would go last, in order for the commits in the code in github not to conflict with each other.

## How you could improve your website in the future

- I do think that more options would be appreciated especially for the functionality of Trends and also other features that would be present in Twitter. However, since it is just a project so as to get familiar with the class, it was sufficient and enjoyable just making the website and applying their functionalities. 

## Other thoughts that might be noteworthy

- Before, the solution/information given prior to the task was lacking and because of it Homer Infante had to come up with a way for the API for the registered users, and was only later on published sir Job's solution in regards to the problem. Which could have made our coding faster and more secure because it had better validations.
